**Hi! I’m Xuan-Ai, a computational biologist**

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Thanks for visiting my website!

I’m a passionate bioinformatics analyst with a background in molecular biology and a strong focus on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Currently completing my PhD in Biomedical Sciences at KU Leuven, my work sits at the intersection of computational biology and stem cell research. From genome editing and high-throughput sequencing to building a human embryo atlas, my research aims to decode complex biological systems and contribute to the understanding and treatment of human diseases.

With hands-on experience in R, Python, and high-performance computing environments, I specialize in processing large-scale omics datasets - including scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, sc multimonics and CUT&RUN - and transforming them into meaningful biological insights. I've had the privilege of collaborating with international research teams and publishing in high-impact journals like Cell Stem Cell.

Beyond the data, I enjoy mentoring students, managing research projects, and communicating science in ways that make it accessible and actionable. I’m always open to collaborations that push the boundaries of what's possible in biomedical research.
