**Hi! Iâ€™m Xuan-Ai, a computational biologist**

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Thanks for visiting my website! I am a PhD candidate at the Stem Cell Institute at KU Leuven, Belgium, specializing in human pluripotent stem cells. My research focuses on uncovering the factors that drive cell fate specification during human embryo development, using advanced single-cell omics techniques and genome editing. I am passionate about using bioinformatics to drive innovative breakthroughs in science and am always eager to tackle new challenges.
